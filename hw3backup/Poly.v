(** Let's see how to write some numbers with this notation. Iterating
    a function once should be the same as just applying it. Thus, *)

Definition one : nat :=
  fun (X : Type) (f : X -> X) (x : X) => f x.

(** Similarly, [two] should apply [f] twice to its argument: *)

Definition two : nat :=
  fun (X : Type) (f : X -> X) (x : X) => f (f x).

(** Defining [zero] is somewhat trickier: how can we "apply a function
    zero times"? The answer is actually simple: just return the
    argument untouched. *)

Definition zero : nat :=
  fun (X : Type) (f : X -> X) (x : X) => x.

(** More generally, a number [n] can be written as [fun X f x => f (f
    ... (f x) ...)], with [n] occurrences of [f].  Notice in
    particular how the [doit3times] function we've defined previously
    is actually just the Church representation of [3]. *)

Definition three : nat := @doit3times.

(** Complete the definitions of the following functions. Make sure
    that the corresponding unit tests pass by proving them with
    [reflexivity]. *)

(** Successor of a natural number: *)

Definition succ (n : nat) : nat :=
  (* FILL IN HERE *) admit.

Example succ_1 : succ zero = one.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example succ_2 : succ one = two.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example succ_3 : succ two = three.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** Addition of two natural numbers: *)

Definition plus (n m : nat) : nat :=
  (* FILL IN HERE *) admit.

Example plus_1 : plus zero one = one.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example plus_2 : plus two three = plus three two.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example plus_3 :
  plus (plus two two) three = plus one (plus three three).
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** Multiplication: *)

Definition mult (n m : nat) : nat :=
  (* FILL IN HERE *) admit.

Example mult_1 : mult one one = one.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example mult_2 : mult zero (plus three three) = zero.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example mult_3 : mult two three = plus three three.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** Exponentiation: *)

(** (_Hint_: Polymorphism plays a crucial role here.  However,
    choosing the right type to iterate over can be tricky.  If you hit
    a "Universe inconsistency" error, try iterating over a different
    type: [nat] itself is usually problematic.) *)

Definition exp (n m : nat) : nat :=
  (* FILL IN HERE *) admit.

Example exp_1 : exp two two = plus two two.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example exp_2 : exp three two = plus (mult two (mult two two)) one.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

Example exp_3 : exp three zero = one.
Proof. (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
